We are now well practiced in conducting digital milestone meetings, so it was no surprise that this year's meeting also took place in virtual form.
The focus of the first day was on the results of the different work packages. On the second day, we focused on organizational topics such as the 
final report, on the one hand, and very specific topics of our MVP, on the other.
We ended the evening of the first day at least in a virtual round with free discussion and some games.
The  PTKA was also present the whole time - many thanks for that!
