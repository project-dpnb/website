The end of the project is approaching and so we met for the final meeting on November 24. The agenda included a review of the project time and short presentations by the project partners. After the lunch break the lessons learned were worked out and after an impulse talk by Prof. Furmans the future cooperation was explored. The meeting was rounded off by the presentation of a spin-off, a presentation on a dissertation written in the project and an external project presentation. The PTKA was again present the whole time and had helpful hints at the end - many thanks for that!
